      This is Neumorphism. Look it up, it's a new UI trend for 2020 and it's awful.
      There's no good way to convey hovering, and that alone kills our very interactive
      UI goal. It's too sotft as well,making it hard to see. UI needs to be easily seen
      by all, there has to be contrast. Neumorphism seems to lack that. This will <b>not</b>
      be used in Inquantir.
